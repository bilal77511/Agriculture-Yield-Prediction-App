# 🌾 Agricultural Yield Prediction App

Welcome to the **Agricultural Yield Prediction App**! This application leverages the power of the [**Granite-3B**](https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-3b-code-base) to predict agricultural yield based on various factors such as climate zone, region, soil type, and more. The app is built with **Streamlit**, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for making predictions.

## 🚀 Demo

## 📋 Features

- 🌎 **Climate Zone and Region:** Specify the climate zone and region of your farm to get tailored predictions.
- 🌱 **Soil and Crop Type:** Input soil type and crop variety to enhance prediction accuracy.
- 🌧️ **Weather Conditions:** Include historical weather data, current weather conditions, and soil moisture levels.
- 💧 **Irrigation and Fertilization:** Specify irrigation methods and fertilizer details.
- 🖊️ **Custom Prompts:** Use custom prompts for personalized predictions.
- 📊 **Yield Units and Prediction Period:** Define the units for yield (e.g., tons per acre) and the prediction period (e.g., weekly, monthly).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Streamlit:** A framework for building interactive web apps with Python.
- **IBM API:** Used for generating yield predictions using the Granite-3b-code-base model.
- **Python:** Backend logic and API integration.
- **Environment Variables:** For secure API key management.

## 📦 Installation

Follow these steps to set up the app on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agricultural-yield-prediction-app.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd agricultural-yield-prediction-app
    ```

3. **Install the required Python packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install streamlit groq
    ```

4. **Set up your API key:**

    Replace `'your_ibm_api_key_here'` in the script with your actual Ibm API key:

    ```python
    os.environ["IBM_API_KEY"] = "your_ibm_api_key_here"
    ```

5. **Run the app:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## 🖥️ How to Use

1. **Open the app using the demo link provided above or run it locally using Streamlit.**
2. **Choose the input method:** Use a custom prompt or fill in parameters for a structured input.
3. **Enter the required details:** Depending on your chosen method, fill in climate zone, region, soil type, weather conditions, and other relevant fields.
4. **Click the "Predict Yield" button** to generate the yield prediction.
5. **Clear inputs** using the "Clear" button if you want to start over.
